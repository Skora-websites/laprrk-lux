We work with clients across India and the United States, and the two locations give us overlapping working hours so that US clients can meet our team during their business day while delivery continues in India.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you sign an NDA before we share project details?",
    a: "Yes. We are happy to sign a mutual non-disclosure agreement from the first conversation, before you share requirements, documents, candidate briefs or training needs. Our team members are also bound by confidentiality obligations, and access to client systems and data is limited to the people who need it for the engagement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do we start an engagement with you?",
    a: "Most engagements begin with a short discovery call to understand your goals, timelines and constraints. We then share a written proposal covering scope, approach, team, timeline and commercials. Once you approve it, we sign the agreement and NDA, agree a kickoff date and name a single point of contact who stays with you throughout.",

    q: "Which of your three divisions should I contact?",
    a: "Contact IT Services for software, AI, cloud, data, QA or security work, Hiring Consultation for recruitment, staffing or team setup, and Corporate Training for upskilling employees or programmes for institutes. If your need spans more than one area, such as hiring and training a fresher batch, one coordinator will bring the right teams together.",
  },
  {
    q: "In which currencies can we pay, and what invoices do you issue?",
    a: "We invoice Indian clients in INR and international clients in USD, with GST-compliant invoices carrying our GSTIN for Indian billing. Payment terms are agreed in the proposal and typically follow milestones for projects, monthly cycles for ongoing services and success fees for permanent hiring.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you work with small companies and startups?",
    a: "Yes. Our clients range from early-stage startups to established enterprises and educational institutions. We scale the team and engagement model to your needs, whether that is a single contract engineer, a small development team, one key hire or a training batch of ten people.",
